Those are my solution codes for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), written in Python.

Usually, I create a method `solve(content: str)` which takes the input as parameter, and returns the solution
to both parts. When the 2 parts have very different solutions, I create 2 methods `part1(content: str)` and
`part2(content: str)`, which return the solution for their respective part.
I set a variable named `test_content` with the example input, directly in the Python file.
For most days to work, you must put your own real input in a file named `<2_digit_day>.txt` (e.g `01.txt`, `23.txt`),
next to the Python file itself.

I added my solutions for various other challenges as well,
most notably those available (in French) at https://www.isograd-testingservices.com/FR/solutions-challenges-de-code.
