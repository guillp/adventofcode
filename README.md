Those are my solution codes for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), written in Python.

For most days to work, you must put your input in a file named `<day>.txt` next to the Python file itself.
Usually, I set a variable named `content` with the example input, and which is overwritten by the input file content.
Just comment in or out the lines where the file is read to test the script on the example or the real input.

I added my solutions for various other challenges as well, 
most notably those available (in French) at https://www.isograd-testingservices.com/FR/solutions-challenges-de-code.
